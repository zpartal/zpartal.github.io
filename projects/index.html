    	<h3>Piano Fun!</h3>
    	<p>Piano fun is virtual piano app for Windows 8 that I wrote during a 24 hour Microsoft sponsored hackathon at Texas A&M in February 2013. The app even lets you select through multiple octaves for the ability to play a large range of notes. The app can be downloaded from the Windows 8 Store from this <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/piano-fun/c35a5143-e947-414f-928a-2bc40f4b698a">link</a>.</p>

		  </li>
		</ul>
    	<h3>Hangman Fun!</h3>
    	<p>Hangman Fun is an app I wrote for Microsofts App Madness program in March 2013. It is the classic hangman game designed for Windows 8 touch screen devices. The app can be downloaded from the Windows 8 Store from this <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/piano-fun/c35a5143-e947-414f-928a-2bc40f4b698a">link</a>.</p>

    	<h3>Tic Tac Attack!</h3>
    	<p>Tic Tac Attack is an app I wrote for Microsofts App Madness program in March 2013. It is the classic tic tac toe game designed for Windows 8 touch screen devices. The app features three modes of game play. You can play against another human, against an easy computer that chooses random moves and against a hard computer which tries its best to win. The app can be downloaded from the Windows 8 Store from this <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/tic-tac-attack/ea4dca02-894c-474b-8b61-28dbc11e72ad">link</a>.</p>
